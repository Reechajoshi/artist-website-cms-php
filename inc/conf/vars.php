He decided to learn the basics of music at the age of 15 by learning to play the keyboard. Which is why he met Paul, a guy who taught Gospel music to the Christian students around. Paul became his mentor in marking up the chords and bases of keyboards.
				At the age of 17, Jishnu was a keyboardist in the band based Jeddah, named ‘Clash’ with the base genre of Hip Hop. He was the programmer of the band. Jishnu soon migrated to the band ‘Black Memories’ as a Music Producer/Music Director, when Hip Hop & Rap caused a headache.
				‘Black Memories’ opened a different door for Jishnu. From Hip Hop, he was interested in creating Smooth Chill and Ambient tracks. With the lead vocals of Sarah, Divya & Vinay, his first music composition named; ‘Emotions’ was brought out.
				He did not get a great response, as he was working on Arabian music market and no one would really listen to the English Chill music. His 12th exams were nearby and band doors were closed by his parents. However, everything changed once again when he came to India.
				When he started doing Bachelor of Computer Applications in a Coimbatore based college, he formed an artist name ‘Faces’ to represent the faces of music.

				Soon their interest in Alternative Rock music was rising up and they released another Rock genre based track named, “Puthusuryannai” and it’s unplugged version made it to the artist page of local newspapers. Since their tracks were having great responses, they started setting up Electronic, Melody & Pop tracks.
				“My Love” was the first electronic/club track that they brought and the approach of audience on that song was average as compared to their last releases. They then created a melody song named, “Ninnormakal” that featured singer Jyotsna K Nanu.
				Soon, they released another track called “ Nenjinulil Neeye”, which was a romantic hit in their home town. Classical Jazz track “Azhage Vaa” was done along with the track “E Kuliril” that featured singer Ajay Satyan in which Romance was the vein of Music and Lyrics.
